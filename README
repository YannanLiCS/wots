Go implementation of Winternitz-Lamport-Diffie one-time signature scheme.

If the hash function is one-way and of sufficient length, the private key is
random, not known to the attacker, and used to sign only one message, and
there are no bugs in this implementation, it is infeasible to forge
signatures (even on quantum computer, provided that it can't break the
underlying hash function).
